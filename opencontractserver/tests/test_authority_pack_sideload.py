"""The sideload contract: how an install finds packs that are not in the tree.

The product tree ships one worked example pack. A body of regulation a
deployment actually curates is *its* data, versioned on its own cadence, and
reaches the install through ``AUTHORITY_PACK_ROOTS`` (a directory of packs — one
variable per pack repository) or ``AUTHORITY_PACK_PATHS`` (one entry per pack).
These tests pin discovery, precedence, de-duplication, and the command-line
preflight an operator runs before installing something they did not build.
