"""Shared ``user_can`` bodies for both Manager/QuerySet and instance surfaces.

Lives in its own module so ``shared/Managers.py``, ``shared/QuerySets.py``,
and any model that needs the instance-side delegate (``BaseOCModel`` and the
``TreeNode``-rooted ``Corpus`` / ``CorpusFolder``) can mix these in without
dragging ``utils/permissioning`` — which calls ``get_user_model()`` at
import time via the GraphQL middleware — into the early ``shared.Models``
⇄ ``users.models`` startup chain.

Two mixins, two signatures:

- ``UserCanMixin`` — for Managers and QuerySets. Method takes
  ``(self, user, instance, permission)``. Used by ``BaseVisibilityManager``
  and ``PermissionedTreeQuerySet``.

- ``InstanceUserCanMixin`` — for model classes. Method takes
  ``(self, user, permission)`` and routes through
  ``type(self)._default_manager.user_can`` so per-model overrides live in
  one place (the Manager / QuerySet). Used by ``BaseOCModel`` and by
  ``TreeNode``-rooted models whose default manager exposes the same
  contract (``Corpus``, ``CorpusFolder``).

Also exports :func:`resolve_user_for_user_can` — the shared int/str-id →
``User`` resolver used by every per-model ``user_can`` override and by the
``_default_user_can`` body. Centralising it here removes the ~40 lines of
duplicated resolution boilerplate that previously lived in every manager
(see Claude review on PR #1663) and ensures the int/str/None/AnonymousUser
contract stays consistent across surfaces.

        to ``False``). Otherwise returns the resolved ``User`` instance (or

    ``RelationshipManager.user_can`` and ``_default_user_can``:

    - ``None`` → ``None`` (caller maps to ``False``).

      ``DoesNotExist`` and ``ValueError`` (raised when the str isn't a
      valid PK — e.g. ``""``, a GraphQL global id, or an arbitrary
      label) → ``None``. The legacy duplicated bodies caught
      ``DoesNotExist`` only and would propagate ``ValueError``; the
      unified contract treats both as a deny so callers can stay
      try-free.
    - Anything else (a ``User``, ``AnonymousUser``, or duck-typed user) →
      returned as-is.

    The ``str`` branch is defensive: GraphQL's PK serialisers sometimes hand
    back string-encoded integers and we want one resolver to handle both.

    Important when mixed onto a QuerySet (e.g. ``PermissionedTreeQuerySet``):
    ``user_can`` is a **single-object authorization check on the supplied
    ``instance`` argument**. It does NOT consult the QuerySet's current
    WHERE clause. ``Corpus.objects.filter(is_public=True).user_can(user,
    some_private_corpus, READ)`` evaluates against ``some_private_corpus``
    on its own merits — the ``filter(is_public=True)`` is ignored. Use
    ``visible_to_user`` if you want a queryset filter.
