"""``BaseService`` — shared machinery for the OpenContracts service layer.

Every concrete service (``opencontractserver/*/services/*.py``) inherits
``BaseService``. It centralises the cross-cutting behaviour so per-model
services stay small and contain only model-specific fetch/mutate logic:

- IDOR-safe single-object lookup (``get_or_none``)
- permission-filtered queryset access (``filter_visible`` for new querysets
  from a model manager; ``filter_visible_qs`` for chaining onto an
  existing queryset or related manager in a single SQL pass)
- a uniform permission gate for write operations (``require_permission``)
- a boolean companion for UI-state flags (``user_has``)
- structured action logging (``log_action``)

Services are classmethod/staticmethod based — there is no per-call service
instance. Subclasses call ``cls.get_or_none(...)`` etc. directly.

Part of the Phase 1 service-layer foundation — see
docs/refactor_plans/2026-05-19-service-layer-centralization-design.md.

        Models that keep the bare ``BaseVisibilityManager`` (``UserExport``,
        ``UserImport``, ``CorpusAction``, ...) do NOT — their manager has the
