    Shared by ``AnnotationManager.user_can`` and
    ``RelationshipManager.user_can`` — both models carry
    ``created_by_analysis`` / ``created_by_extract`` FKs and enforce the
    same source-permission rule (relationships gained the recursion in the
    2026-06 permissioning audit, closing the Phase-C deferral from issue
    #1655).

    Three outcomes:
    - ``True`` for the structural-READ short-circuit (structural rows are
      always READable when the parent doc is).
    - ``True`` when the row has neither ``created_by_analysis`` nor
      ``created_by_extract`` set (privacy recursion is a no-op).
    - For analysis/extract-rooted rows, the requested permission must hold
      on the source object as well as doc+corpus. Delegates to
      ``Analysis.objects.user_can`` / ``Extract.objects.user_can`` so
      creator status on the source is honored.

    Callers have already denied non-READ structural requests (the
    structural-write break-glass runs first), so ``structural and READ`` is
    the only structural state we can still be in — but we keep the explicit
    ``and permission == READ`` for readability rather than relying on the
    flow-sensitive equivalence.

    Deleted-source posture: both FKs are ``on_delete=SET_NULL``, so deleting
    the source Analysis/Extract NULLs the FK and the row becomes a normal
    (non-private) row — deletion does NOT permanently lock rows. The
    ``source is None`` branches below fire only in the race window where the
    id column is read before the SET_NULL lands; they fail closed for that
    window, by design.

    Performance note: the FK descriptors (``instance.created_by_analysis``
    / ``created_by_extract``) hit the database once each per call when the
    relations aren't prefetched. Callers that invoke ``user_can`` in a loop

           passes through).

           non-READ denied.

           a ``structural=True`` annotation: True for superusers, False for
           everyone else. This is NOT a blanket superuser bypass — outside
           this single branch superusers are computed exactly like a normal
           user (scoped admin access, 2026-05).
        5. **Row-creator source-privacy exemption** for supported annotation
           permissions (mirrors ``AnnotationQuerySet.visible_to_user``'s
           ``Q(creator=user)`` branch). This bypasses only the source privacy
           recursion; document/corpus permissions are still computed below.
        6. **Privacy recursion** (only when not structural-READ and the row
           creator exemption does not apply): see
           ``_source_privacy_recursion_passes`` (module-level, shared with
           ``RelationshipManager``).
        7. ``document_id is None`` → READ via ``visible_to_user(...).exists()``
           (covers the structural_set route), non-READ denied.
        8. **MIN(doc, corpus)** → see
           ``_compute_annotation_effective_permission``.

        Phase B (issue #1655): the privacy recursion delegates to
        ``Analysis.objects.user_can`` / ``Extract.objects.user_can`` per
        call. Without a request-scoped cache wrapped by
        ``permission_cache_scope``, a GraphQL resolver fanning out
        ``user_can`` over a list of analysis-/extract-created annotations
        re-derefs and re-checks the source Analysis/Extract per row.
        Activate the cache at request scope before this becomes a
        scaling issue.

        Performance note: the privacy-recursion branch dereferences
        ``instance.created_by_analysis`` / ``instance.created_by_extract``
        when their FK ids are set — those descriptors hit the database
        once each per call when the relations aren't prefetched. Bulk
        callers (e.g. GraphQL list resolvers iterating annotations)
        SHOULD ``select_related("created_by_analysis",
        "created_by_extract")`` on their root queryset to avoid one
        extra query per row. The ``AnnotationService`` already
        batches the MIN(doc, corpus) computation; only the privacy
        recursion path is unbatched today.

        Anonymous-path note: the ``visible_to_user(...).filter(pk=).exists()``
        query for anonymous READ is also a per-call DB round-trip with
        no batched alternative — bulk anonymous filtering should call
        ``visible_to_user(anon).filter(pk__in=[...])`` directly rather
        than looping ``user_can`` per row.
