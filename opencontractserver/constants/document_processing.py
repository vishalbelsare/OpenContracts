# creating the row).  The backend treats it as a *title* — it queries
# ``Document.objects.filter(title=CAML_ARTICLE_TITLE)``.  The two names
# refer to the same literal value (``"Readme.CAML"``) and MUST stay in

# microservice embeds ~100 short sentences in ~25s, but authority-corpus text
# (whole ordinance sections, statute chapters) is far longer per row, and a
# batch of 100 of those overruns the HTTP read timeout. A timed-out batch is

# client retries the whole batch (3 attempts) the queue burns ~3 minutes per
# task while making no progress — a large ingest can stop draining entirely.
# Better to let a slow batch finish once than to redo it three times.
#
# Tradeoff: this is a per-attempt read timeout, and the shared session's
# urllib3 Retry (read=3, see sent_transformer_microservice.py) sits *under*
# Celery's own autoretry (max_retries=3). A genuinely hung (not just slow)
# microservice can now tie up a worker for up to ~300s x 3 x 4 in the worst
# case, vs. ~3 minutes at the old 60s ceiling. Accepted for now because the

# truncation that ``sentence-transformers`` applies locally so OpenAI users
# get the same robustness instead of a fatal 400 "maximum context length"
