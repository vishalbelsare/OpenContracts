"""
Dual-Tree Document Versioning Operations

This module implements the core operations for the dual-tree versioning architecture.
It provides functions for import, move, delete, restore, and query operations on documents
within the corpus filesystem.

Architecture Rules Implemented:
- Content Tree (Document model):
  - C1: New Document only when hash first seen in THIS corpus
  - C2: Updates create child nodes of previous version
  - C3: Only one current Document per version tree

- Path Tree (DocumentPath model):
  - P1: Every lifecycle event creates new node
  - P2: New nodes are children of previous state
  - P3: Only current filesystem state is is_current=True
  - P4: One active path per (corpus, path) tuple
  - P5: Version number increments only on content changes
  - P6: Folder deletion sets folder=NULL

- Interaction Rules (Updated for Corpus Isolation):
  - I1: Corpuses have completely isolated Documents with independent version trees
  - I2: Provenance tracked via source_document field
  - I3: File storage can be deduplicated by hash (blob sharing, not Document sharing)
  - Q1: Content "truly deleted" when no active paths point to it
