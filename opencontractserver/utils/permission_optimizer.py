"""Request-scoped cache for granted permission sets.

Tier 2 of the two-tier mitigation described in issue #1640 (the follow-up to
PR #1637, which centralized authorization in ``Manager.user_can`` /
``obj.user_can`` → ``_default_user_can``). The accompanying Tier 1 is the
per-instance memoization that lives inside
``opencontractserver.utils.permissioning.get_users_permissions_for_obj``.

This module follows a self-contained request-optimizer idiom:

- A small class with explicit ``invalidate`` / ``invalidate_caches`` methods.
- A ``get_request_optimizer(request)`` helper that lazy-attaches the
  optimizer to the request once, keyed by an attribute name shared with
  :mod:`opencontractserver.constants.permissioning`.
- ``None``-tolerant: outside the HTTP request lifecycle (Celery tasks,
  management commands) callers get a one-shot optimizer that goes away
  with the local scope.

See ``docs/architecture/query_permission_patterns.md`` for how this fits
into the wider visibility / permission stack.

    request — every cache entry tags the ``user_id`` explicitly. This keeps
    the request-attribute count down and lets the Manager/QuerySet
    ``user_can`` API stay user-agnostic at the surface.

    The cache stores ``frozenset[str]`` (immutable). Callers receive
    ``set[str]`` copies because the consumer in ``_default_user_can``
    mutates the returned set locally when handling compound permission

        (the Tier 1 instance attribute and this request-scoped dict).
