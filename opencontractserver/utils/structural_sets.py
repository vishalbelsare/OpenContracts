"""
Shared helper for materialising a document's structural annotations into a
:class:`~opencontractserver.annotations.models.StructuralAnnotationSet`.

The parser pipeline (``BaseParser.save_parsed_data``) and the worker-upload
ingestion path (``opencontractserver.worker_uploads.tasks``) both need to take
the structural annotations a parser produced (``structural=True``, still bound
to ``document``) and migrate them into a shared ``StructuralAnnotationSet`` so
they are stored once, embedded with corpus-specific embedders, and resolved
through the same structural-set join the rest of the platform relies on (see
``AnnotationService.get_document_annotations``). Keeping the logic in one place
guarantees the two ingestion paths produce an identical end-state — a document
ingested locally by the parser and the same document ingested remotely and
pushed through worker-upload are byte-for-byte equivalent in their structural
layer.

    Create a :class:`StructuralAnnotationSet` for *document* and migrate its
    structural annotations and relationships into it.

    The migration enforces the model's XOR constraint (an annotation/relationship
    belongs to *either* a ``document`` *or* a ``structural_set``, never both) by
    nulling ``document`` as each row is re-homed onto the set, then links the
    document to the set.

    Idempotent: a document that already has a structural set, or that has no
    structural annotations, is a no-op (returns the existing set or ``None``).
    ``get_or_create`` on the content hash tolerates retry scenarios where the
    set was created but the document link was not saved.

    Args:
        document: The ``Document`` whose structural annotations should migrate.
        user: The user to credit as the set's creator.
        parser_name: Name of the parser that produced the structural layer
            (stored on the set for provenance / dedup bookkeeping).
        parser_version: Version string for the parser.

    Returns:
        The (created or reused) ``StructuralAnnotationSet``, or ``None`` if the
        document had no structural annotations to migrate.
