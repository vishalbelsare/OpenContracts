    Given an instance of a django Model, a user id or instance, and a list of desired permissions,

    de-provision a user's permissions.

    This doesn't affect permissions provided from other avenues besides object-level permissions. For example, if
    they're a superuser, they'll still have permissions. Also, if an object is public, they'll still have read
    permissions (assuming they're part of the read public objects group).

            replace semantics for sharing flows / permission downgrades that
            depend on prior perms being cleared (e.g. CRUD → READ-only).
            Ingest paths (``import_annotations``, ``corpus.add_document``,

    Single source of truth for "does this user have ``permission`` on
    ``instance``?" for any model that uses the standard rules. Both
    ``BaseVisibilityManager.user_can`` and ``PermissionedTreeQuerySet.user_can``
    delegate here, which keeps the filter (``visible_to_user``) and check
    (``user_can``) decisions provably aligned.

    Naming note: the leading underscore marks this as implementation-private
    to the permission subsystem (callers go through ``Manager.user_can`` /
    ``obj.user_can``), NOT as file-private. ``Managers.py``, ``QuerySets.py``,
    and ``UserCanMixin`` deliberately import it. Per-model overrides that
    need the default rules MUST delegate here rather than re-implementing
    them, so filter/check stay aligned.

    Rules:
        - ``None`` / ``AnonymousUser`` / unauthenticated → False, except READ
          on ``instance.is_public=True`` which returns True.
        - Superuser → True for every permission.
        - Authenticated, non-superuser:
            * For READ: True iff ``is_public`` or ``creator_id == user.id`` or
              the user has the corresponding guardian codename (user perms,
              optionally group perms).
            * For non-READ: True iff ``creator_id == user.id`` or the user
              has the corresponding guardian codename. ``is_public`` does NOT
              grant write permissions — preserves the read/write asymmetry
              enforced today by the deleted ``FolderService.check_corpus_*``
              helpers.
            * For ``CRUD``: requires all four base perms (CREATE, READ,
              UPDATE, DELETE). ``is_public`` is folded in locally as a
              synthetic ``read_<model>`` so a user with explicit write
              grants on a public corpus passes CRUD — preserves the same
              semantics as a series of individual ``user_can`` calls.
            * For ``ALL``: requires all seven perms (same ``is_public``
              fold-in as CRUD).
            * Creator short-circuit applies BEFORE compound checks, so the
              corpus creator passes ``CRUD`` / ``ALL`` without needing
              explicit guardian grants (mirrors the deleted FolderService
              behavior; pinned by
              ``test_creator_passes_compound_perms_without_explicit_grants``).
        - ``EDIT`` is treated as an alias for ``UPDATE``.

    Per-model overrides (e.g. ``AnnotationManager.user_can``) MUST add their
    own structural / privacy / inheritance rules before delegating here,
    and MUST forward ``request`` through so the optimization composes.

    Caching layers (issue #1640):

    1. ``permission_cache_scope`` (request-scoped boolean cache, dormant
       until Phase B activates it via middleware). Wraps the cold path so
       the same ``(user, instance, permission)`` tuple is computed at most
       once per scope.
    2. ``PermissionQueryOptimizer`` (Tier 2 active cache, opt-in via the
       optional ``request`` kwarg). When ``request is not None`` the
       granted-set lookup goes through the optimizer so multiple
       instances of the same model in one request share a cache.
    3. ``get_users_permissions_for_obj`` instance-memoized cache (Tier 1,
       always-on). Same-instance repeat checks short-circuit at the
       guardian-lookup boundary.

    The three layers compose: scope → optimizer → per-instance.

    """IDOR-safe object lookup for non-corpus-scoped models.

    Returns the instance iff it exists AND ``user`` can READ it, otherwise
    ``None``. The single ``None`` return collapses "pk doesn't exist" and
    "pk exists but caller lacks READ" into one indistinguishable response
    so call sites can render a single unified error message — preventing
    enumeration via timing or differential error text (CLAUDE.md "IDOR
    Prevention").

    Garbage pk input (non-integer string on an integer-pk model, ``None``,
    or anything else the ORM rejects with ``ValueError`` / ``TypeError``)
    also returns ``None`` rather than raising; callers receive untrusted
    ids from GraphQL and must not surface a 500 on malformed input.

    Caller responsibility: this helper enforces ONLY the READ gate. If the
    mutation requires UPDATE / DELETE / PERMISSION, layer the additional
    check (via ``user_can``) AFTER the helper returns and emit the same
    unified ``"<resource> not found or
    you don't have permission to <verb> it."`` message on failure so the
    UPDATE-vs-READ branches stay indistinguishable to the caller.

    For DOCUMENT lookups in a CORPUS context, prefer
    :meth:`opencontractserver.corpuses.services.corpus_documents.CorpusDocumentService.get_corpus_document_by_id`
    instead — it enforces corpus READ as the gate (the more restrictive
    check) and is the canonical service-layer entry point for the
    "is this document in this corpus, for this user" question. Phase D
    deliberately does NOT introduce a parallel doc-by-pk lookup helper
    that would race against the service.
