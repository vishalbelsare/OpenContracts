"""
Central registry of all pipeline components with lazy initialization.

This module provides an efficient, cached registry of pipeline components
(parsers, embedders, thumbnailers, post-processors) that:
1. Auto-discovers components on first access (no manual registration needed)
2. Caches component tables while observing shared pack activation versions
3. Exposes fast lookup functions similar to the tool_registry pattern

Performance:
- First access: ~50-100ms (module scanning)
- Subsequent accesses: one version-id query; rediscovery only after activation changes

    Packs that lived in-tree hid this by being importable as real packages;
    the moment one is sideloaded, that absolute path stops resolving. Creating
    the parents makes ordinary relative imports work identically in-tree and
    out, which is what "a pack is copy-to-port" requires.

    ``__path__`` is re-pointed on every call rather than skipped when the module
    already exists: ``reset_registry()`` re-runs discovery, and a test (or an
    operator) may have swapped which directory a given pack name resolves to.
    Re-pointing alone is not enough — an import resolves against
    ``sys.modules[<pkg>.<sub>]`` before it ever consults the parent's

        (``<pack>/<subdir_name>/*.py``).

        Generalizes the "self-contained pack" discovery mechanism across every
        component family that follows the pack-directory convention — today
        ``BaseAuthoritySourceProvider`` under ``<pack>/providers/`` and
        ``BaseAuthorityDiscoveryProvider`` under ``<pack>/discovery_providers/`` —
        so a pack ships either (or both) kind of component the same way:
        discovered by the registry, no registration call, no core edit. This is
        what makes a pack self-contained: its scraper(s) live in the pack
        directory rather than in a shared core package, so copying the pack to
        another install brings them with it. The subdirectory name is part of
        the synthetic module path, so a pack shipping BOTH kinds of component
        cannot collide on the same module name.

        Each module is imported by file path under a synthetic, collision-free
        module name; an import failure is logged and skipped so a bad pack never
        crashes registry build (matching ``_discover_subclasses``' isolation).
        Only classes DEFINED in the pack module are registered — base/imported
        classes that merely happen to be in scope are ignored via the
        ``__module__`` check.

    Most packs should not ship a scraper: core already covers the Code of
    Federal Regulations, the U.S. Code and the Federal Register, and those
    providers fail to fire for a pack only because of key SHAPE — the CFR
    provider accepts ``cfr-{digits}:`` while a pack's sections are keyed
    ``itar:``, ``ear:``, ``aeca:``. A pack already declares that translation in
    its own equivalence rows, so the in-pack provider is a key translator plus a
    delegation (authority-packs ``SOURCE_PROVIDERS.md``).

    Doing that by importing the core class directly works, but couples every
    such pack to an import path: a refactor of the core providers would break
    them, and registry discovery isolates import failures by design, so the
    breakage would be a logged warning and a provider that silently stopped
    existing. Depending on this function instead makes the class name the
    contract.

    Returns ``None`` when no provider of that class name is registered — a pack
    MUST handle that by declining (``can_handle`` -> False) rather than raising,
    so an install missing a core provider degrades to "cannot re-fetch" instead
    of breaking registry build.
