"""Install a DOMAIN pack: base packs plus the wiring that belongs to none of them.

    python manage.py install_domain_pack us-export-control --creator admin --public
    python manage.py install_domain_pack us-export-control --check
    python manage.py install_domain_pack --list

A **base pack** is one body of law — one publisher, one update cadence, one
provenance story, one approval status. A **domain pack** composes base packs and
supplies the parts that exist only because they are installed together:

    * a CorpusGroup, so cross-corpus retrieval reaches every member;
    * an orchestrator AgentConfiguration bound to that group, carrying the
      tools and the persona describing how those bodies of law interact;
    * cross-pack equivalences — citation forms owned by one pack that must fold
      onto keys owned by another.

Without this layer a multi-corpus assembly installs "successfully" and lands
inert: its content is present and correct, and everything except the corpora a
consuming document happens to cite is unreachable.

The install contract (C1-C7) is defined in the registry repo's DOMAIN_PACKS.md
and is the shared spec both sides build to. The assertions this command owns:

    C1 Completeness   — every required base pack installs, or we fail.
    C2 Reachability   — every contributed corpus joins the group; exceeding the
                        platform's group cap is an ERROR, never a silent
                        truncation.
    C3 Addressability — the orchestrator exists, is bound, and has its tools.
    C5 Honesty        — success is not printable while any assertion is unmet.
    C6 Idempotence    — re-running converges; nothing is duplicated.

C4 (every equivalence target resolves) and C7 (a domain pack introduces no
authority of its own) are decidable from the files and are enforced by the
registry's ``scripts/validate_domain.py``; both are re-checked here because an
installer must not trust its input.
