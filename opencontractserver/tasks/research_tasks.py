    ``ask_document`` and the rest come from the corpus agent and are registered
    by the factory — so ``tool_call_log`` recorded roughly half of what a run
    did and the Run details tab presented that half as the whole.

    The cost of the gap was not cosmetic. Ten runs were read off that log as
    having retrieved only by exact phrase and never once by meaning, and a
    prompt was rewritten on the strength of it; the worker log showed those
    runs embedding query after query, which only ``similarity_search`` does.
    An instrument that cannot see a tool will report that the tool was never
    used.

    ``already_audited`` names the closures this module wrapped itself, and it is
    matched by NAME on purpose. The obvious guard — a marker attribute on the
    wrapper — does not hold: the closures are handed to the factory as caller
    tools and the factory re-wraps them, so the callable reachable at
    ``function_schema.function`` is the factory's wrapper, not ours, and it
    carries no marker. Every closure call was therefore logged twice, which
    would be cosmetic except that the step-budget counter reads the log length:
    a run at 27 real tool calls was being told "54 of 60 used" and pushed to
    finalize with half its budget unspent. The attribute check is kept as a
    second line of defence for anything that does survive.

    ``FunctionSchema.call`` resolves ``self.function`` at call time, so
    replacing it here intercepts every later invocation. Only coroutine
    functions are wrapped: the schema decided sync-vs-async at registration and
    handing it a coroutine where it expects a plain return would break the
    call. Everything in the agent toolset is async by policy (CLAUDE.md), so in
    practice this skips nothing — it is a guard against a future sync tool
    silently breaking every run.
